# irisFlowersClassification
A basic machine learning project using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on petal and sepal measurements. The project includes data visualization, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries like Scikit-learn and Seaborn.


-DETAILS
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model was trained using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, which is a simple, yet effective, supervised learning technique. I utilized the popular Iris dataset, which includes features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

After loading the dataset, I split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. I also visualized the relationship between petal length and petal width using a scatter plot to understand the distribution of the different species. The model was then trained on the training data and tested on the test data, achieving an accuracy score and providing a detailed classification report and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.

This project demonstrates the basics of data handling, visualization, model training, and evaluation in Python using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
