# irisFlowersClassification
A basic machine learning project using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on petal and sepal measurements. The project includes data visualization, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries like Scikit-learn and Seaborn.
